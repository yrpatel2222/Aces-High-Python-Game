The objective of the game is to move all cards to the foundation piles, following specific rules. The game starts with a tableau of four columns and a stock of cards. Players can perform actions such as dealing cards to the tableau, moving cards from the tableau to the foundation, moving cards within the tableau, restarting the game, displaying the menu, and quitting the game.

The code defines functions to initialize the game, deal cards to the tableau, validate and perform moves to the foundation, move cards within the tableau, check for a win, and display the current game state. The main function runs a loop where players input commands to execute various actions, and the game continues until the player either quits or wins.

The game provides a menu with options like dealing cards, moving cards, restarting, and quitting. It also includes error checking for invalid commands and displays the game state after each move.
